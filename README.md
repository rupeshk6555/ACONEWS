## Overview of approach
the ACONEWS project was structured around three key areas: API integration, user interface design, and deployment.

  #### 1. API Integration: 
  I began by connecting to the GNews API to fetch live news data, ensuring efficient usage within the limits of the free tier. I prioritized handling data properly while managing rate limits.

#### 2. Frontend Design:
 The UI was designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, working seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I implemented a full-screen mobile menu and used pagination to display articles smoothly.

#### 3. Deployment: 
After completing the build, I deployed the app on Firebase's free tier, making it easy to access and maintain. The focus was on speed, reliability, and ease of use.


## Description

 During the development of ACONEWS, I faced a few key challenges:

 #### 1. API Rate Limits:
To handle restrictions, I optimized API calls and implemented pagination to reduce the number of requests.
#### 2. Responsive Design:
I used flexible layouts and a full-screen mobile menu to ensure the app worked well on all devices.
#### 3. Firebase Deployment: 
I carefully configured Firebase for smooth hosting and deployment of the app.
